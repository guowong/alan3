/** Provides reflective access to JavaFX values and types.
 *
 * This packages defines a Java API (rather than a JavaFX API), 
 * so it can be used from both Java and JavaFX code.
 * A future JavaFX API may be layered on top of this.
 *
 * <h2>Context</h2>
 * The objects in this package are directly or indirectly created
 * from a {@link javafx.reflect.FXContext FXContext}.
 * In the default case there is a single {@code FXContext} instance that
 * uses Java reflection.  You get one of these by doing:
 * <pre>
 * FXLocal.Context ctx = FXLocal.getContext();
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, you can do:
 * <pre>
 * FXContext ctx = FXContext.getInstance();
 * </pre>
 * The latter is more abstract (as it supports proxying for remote VMs)
 * but the more specific {@code FXLocal.Context} supports some extra
 * operations that only make sense for same-VM reflection.
 *
 * <h2>Values</h2>
 * The various reflection operations do not directly use
 * Java values.  Instead,
 * an {@link javafx.reflect.FXObjectValue} is a <q>handle</q> or
 * proxy for an <code>Object</code>.  This extra layer of indirection
 * isn't needed in many cases, but it is useful for remote invocation,
 * remote control, or in general access to data in a different VM.
 *
 * <h2>Object creation</h2>
 * To do the equivalent of the JavaFX code:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * var x = ...;
 * var z = Foo { a: 10; b: bind x.y };
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * you can do:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * FXContext rcontext = ...;
 * FXClassType cls = rcontext.findClass(...);
 * FXObjectValue x = ...;
 * FXObjectValue z = cls.allocation();
 * z.initVar("a", ???);
 * z.bindVar("b", ???);
 * z.initialize();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <h2>Sequence operations</h2>
 * <p>
 * Use {@link javafx.reflect.FXSequenceBuilder} to create a new sequence.
 * <p>
 * To get the number of items in a sequence,
 * use {@link javafx.reflect.FXValue#getItemCount ValueRef.getItemCount}.
 * To index into a sequence,
 * use {@link javafx.reflect.FXValue#getItem ValueRef.getItem}.
 *
 * <h2>Design notes and issues</h2>
 * Some design principles, influenced by the "Mirrored reflection"
 * APIs (<a href="http://bracha.org/mirrors.pdf">Bracha and Ungar:
 * <cite>Mirrors: Design Principles for Meta-level Facilities
 * of Object-Oritented Programming Languages</cite>, OOPSLA 2004</a>),
 * and <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jpda/jdi/">JDI</a> :
 * <ul>
 * <li>No explicit constructors in user code.
 * <li>Keep everything abstract, and allow indirection.
 * For example, we might be working on objects in the current VM,
 * or a remote VM.  We might not have objects at all - a subset of the same API
 * might be used for (say) reading from {@code .class} files.
 * <li>Hence the core classes are interfaces or abstract.
 * <li>On the other hand, we should avoid useless levels of indirection
 * or "service lookup".
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Error handling isn't very consistent - sometimes we return null, and
 * sometimes we throw an exception.
 * <li>We don't support bound functions properly.
 * </ul>
