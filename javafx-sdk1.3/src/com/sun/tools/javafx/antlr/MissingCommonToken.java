/**
 * An implementation of teh ANTLR 3.x CommonToken, with extra information
 * concerning error recovery.
 *
 * An object of this type is created by the parser error recovery mechanisms
 * when they can determine that a parsing error would be caused by the simple
 * problem of a single missing token, such as an IDENTIFIER or LPAREN etc. The
 * parser will then see the token in the stream as normal, and not throw exceptions
 * (though we do log the error.) The parer rules that care, such as those that
 * need to construct values in the AST, like TIME_LITERAL or STRING_LITERAL etc
 * can then choose to override the default value created by
 * #AbstractGeneratedParserV4.getMissingToken() according to any context information
 * they might have, but more importantly, they can see that the token they have
 * was auto inserted and therefore create differnt AST nodes to indicate the fact.
