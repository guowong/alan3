/**
 * Linkable represents a class that can be linked together with other objects of its kind into a linked list.  There
 * is a link to the next element, and a link back to the previous element, so that elements can be removed.  Usually
 * the list head is not of the same type as the list elements, which is why getPrev() returns Linkable<T> but getNext()
 * returns T; the forward links are used for iteration, the backward links only for removal.
 * 
 * Relevant methods for manipulation, iteration, etc are in Linkables.
